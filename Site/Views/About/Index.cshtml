            Hi, my name is Steven Cantrell! I'm a research engineer and software developer with a background in digital communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My software experience is in application development to aid researchers, like myself, that require automation or tooling to solve complex problems. In my spare time, I'm a self-driven person devoted to learning more about software best practices and honing my design skills. This site is a testament to my engagement in these fundamentals and my playground for creativity.
